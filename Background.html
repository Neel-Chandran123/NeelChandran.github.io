    <h2>
        <p>My name is Neel Chandran, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. </p>
    </h2>
        <h3><p>I'm studying Engineering Physics, with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I want to work with Quantum Computer's when I'm finished and am fascinated by the different methods of Error Correction. I also enjoy Statistical Mechanics and Machine Learning. </p></h3>
        <h3>Here is how I got where I am:</h3>
    <section><p>I grew up right next to UC Berkeley. Being next to campus meant that I was constantly exposed to some of the brightest minds and greatest innovations. I was an active member of Berkeley Math Cirlce, where I was presented with topics such
         as combinatorics, probability theory, calculus, game theory and more advanced level math topics as an elementary schooler. As I grew up I joined my school's mountain biking team, which lead to a passion for the enviornment. Doing a research project with a UC proffessor, gave me experience working in a lab, and introduced me to fields outside of enviornmental science. That's how I found Physics, but I wanted to work with my hands on projects. This what led me to choose Engineering Physics as the best of both worlds!</p></section>
